# Advent of Code
Just doing [advent of code](https://adventofcode.com) to practice C. Currently working through 2024. Will eventually go through 2023.

## Inputs
Actual inputs are not in this repo.

## Running
The solutions do not rely on outside libraries. All utilities are defined in `lib/aoc.h` and a dynamic array is in `lib/aoc_array.h`. Both header files also contain the necessary source code.

[just](https://just.systems) is used as a task runner. Inside each year you can create a day, build, or run. If you are within a day, the default command will compile and run the command.
